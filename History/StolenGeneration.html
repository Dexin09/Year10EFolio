			The Stolen Generation

			The Stolen Generation was a dark time in Australia’s already troubled history.
			It describes the group of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples who were taken away from their families as children.
			It was performed by numerous government agencies and religious organisations.
			The goal was to erase all aspects of Aboriginal Australian identity by forcefully removing children from their homes, and “re-educating” them.
			This was carried our from the 1870s and survived into the late 1960s.
			Truly a disgusting practice, that took way too long to abolish.
			This article seeks to explore this black spot in our history in greater detail.
			</br></br>

			The idea that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures were inferior was the founding factor here.
			Supposedly, forcefully integrating Indigenous youth into a (to them) foreign mainstream Australian society was the best way to "civilize" them, insinuating the Aboriginal society to be inferior, which needed to be cleansed.
			As well as a white superiority complex, there was also an aspect of using certain phrase in order to obtain public approval.
			An obvious use of these were the names of the bills that supported the act of taking away Aboriginal children.
			</br></br>

			One of these bills was the somewhat innocent sounding Aborigines Protection Act, which was passed in New South Wales in 1883.
			However, it was not a bill that protecteded the Aboriginal people.
			This bill allowed an insane amount of government interference about most parts of daily life.
			It dictated where Aboriginal people were allowed to live, their freedom of movement and their personal finances.
			In all likelyhood the worst offence though, is that it facilitated the removal of children from their homes, where they would be "raised like white children".
			The 1911 amendment to the Aboriginal Protection Act established Kinchela Boys Home and Cootamundra Domestic Training Home for Aboriginal Girls.
			Touting in most cases fabricicated welfare reasons, children were seized and placed in institutions where they frequently endured cruel treatment, including emotional and physical abuse.
			Worse again, in 1915, an amendment to the act gave the Board authority to remove Aboriginal children "without having to establish in court that they were neglected."
			Government representatives and legislators reasoned that by taking away children from their homes and placing them in foster homes or institutions run by white people, they could guarantee the children's assimilation into white society by giving them better opportunity for schooling.
			</br></br>

			The notion of "breeding out" the Indigenous population was one of the main driving forces.
			Officials thought that the Aboriginal population would eventually vanish if Indigenous children were raised in white homes and married white people.
			The idea of biological assimilation was combined with a social assimilation approach that aimed to separate Indigenous children from their culture and history by indoctrinating them with Western ideals and standards.
			The removal procedure was frequently cruel and unpleasant.
			
			In retrospect, this is a horrifying concept, for children to be "reeducated" and "reintergrated".
			This process has draw many connections to practices such as eugenics, and gives an impression of an intolerant society overall.
			A profound sense of loss and confusion about who they were resulted in for many youngsters who lost all contact with their relatives and communities.
			Due to the long-lasting impacts of the policy's alienation from culture and family on both the immediately impacted persons and their descendants, there was also severe intergenerational trauma.
			</br></br>

			More frightening still is that this council wasn't abolished until 1969. The disbanding was caused by the 1969 Aborigines Act, which came 2 years after the ammendment to the consitution (that counted Aboriginal people as citizens).
			</br></br>

			Calling this behaviour a mistreatment of an entire race would be an understatement. This racist mission greatly damaged the rich cultural heritage and
